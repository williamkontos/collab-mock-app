# collab-mock-app
#### _wip_

_A mock app I built following a tutorial to better my understanding of Ruby on Rails and Action Cable. It's main functionality is for a user to connect with like minded individuals._ 

Built with...
+ Ruby on Rails
+ Action Cable
+ Faker 
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap
+ JavaScript
+ jQuery 

funcitonality thus far... 
+ Authentication via Devise 
+ Publish, search, and categorize posts
+ Instant messaging 


This app is built heavily with helpers and partials, which is something I wanted to focus on to better familiarize myself with the workflow. 

I was also challenged with working with Action Cable for the first time. One to one chat is functional, still working on implementing a group chat.
